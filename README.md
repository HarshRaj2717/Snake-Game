# Snaky

Snaky is just a simple implementation of the snake game in Python using Tkinter with focus on a simple and clean UI.

# Usage

1. Make sure to install python's turtle library using: `pip install turtle`.
2. Run the main.py file using: `python main.py` in the root folder.
3. This will open up a GUI where you can use your arrow keys to control the snake and collect yellow coloured food items.
